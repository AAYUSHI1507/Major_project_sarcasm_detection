# Major_project_sarcasm_detection

I have developed single Webpage machine learning application name sarcasm detection on newspaper headlines using streamlit.
I have used various newspaper datasets to detect sarcasm in the selected newspaper dataset's headlines i.e. Times of India, BBC News etc.
The model that used in this machine learning application is Linear support vector machine which has the accuracy of 83.38%. This model was choosed based on the various parameters like precision, recall, specificity.


The Dataset used for training and testing the model was TheOnion newspaper and huffingPost newspaper dataset respectively. 

TheOnion    - Aims at producing sarcastic headlines.

HuffingPost - Normal Newspaper headline dataset.

This application will give the visualisation of overall analysis
